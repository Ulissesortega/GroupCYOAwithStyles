# GroupCYOAwithStyles

Group Members: Ulisses, Elizar, Manuel 

In the beginning when choosing which way we wanted to attack this group project, we all thought a good place to start would be with a flowchart so we could format what kind of story we wanted to tell with our CYOA. But, in all honesty we couldn't decide what to do so we chose to do three different stories which is a pretty cool idea because you will have multiple different endings. So we ended up sticking with that and thatâ€™s when we came up with the idea of the blue pill and red pill storyline, Since there were three of us we had to add another option which was taking no pill at all. If you watched the matrix you will see what kind of idea we were going with because each pill had their own different ending and start.
